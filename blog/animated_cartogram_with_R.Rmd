This post describes how to make a smooth transition `.gif` between a classic [choropleth map](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/chloropleth-map/) and a [cartogram](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/cartogram/).  

It starts by doing a basic map of Africa and then distorts country size using the [cartogram](https://github.com/sjewo/cartogram) library. [Ggplot2](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/) is then used to make a nice choropleth version. Finally the [tweenr](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr) and the [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) libraries build a smooth transition between both maps.  

At the end of this post, you should obtain a `.gif file that looks like this:

Before starting, we need a few libraries:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)    # As always
library(cartogram)    # for the cartogram
library(ggplot2)      # to realize the plots
library(broom)        # from geospatial format to data frame
library(tweenr)       # to create transition dataframe between 2 states
library(gganimate)    # To realize the animation
library(maptools)     # world boundaries coordinates
library(viridis)      # for a nice color palette
```



#A basic map of Africa
***

The [maptools library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/maptools.pdf) provides all the information we need to draw a map of Africa. All the country boundaries are stored in the `world_simpl` object. Let’s load this object, keep only Africa, and draw a basic representation.

We only need 3 lines of code to start!

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Get the shape file of Africa
data(wrld_simpl)
afr=wrld_simpl[wrld_simpl$REGION==2,]
 
# A basic representation
plot(afr)
```





#Compute cartogram boundaries
***
The `afr` object is a **spatial object**. Thus it has a `data slot` that gives a few information concerning each region. You can visualise this info typing `afr@data` in our case. You will see that a column called `POP2005` is available, providing the number of inhabitants per country in 2005.  

Using this information we can use the [cartogram library](https://github.com/sjewo/cartogram) to build… a cartogram! Basically, it will distort the shape of every country proportionally to its number of inhabitants. The output is a new geospatial object that we can map like we’ve done before.  

As you can see in the image on the left, Nigeria appears way bigger on this map, since it has a population of about 141M inhabitants!
